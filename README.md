## Data Availability and Downloading

This project uses four data files from Add Health Publicly-Use Data Sets. Add Health is a school-based longitudinal study of a nationally-representative sample of adolescents in grades 7-12 in the United States in 1994-95. Information about obtaining the data can be accessed from the [Add Health Data](https://addhealth.cpc.unc.edu/data/). 

Follow the steps below to download all datasets needed to replicate the results.

**Step 1** Enter the [Add Health Public-Use Data website](https://addhealth.cpc.unc.edu/data/#public-use). Click the first option underneath the "Getting Public-Use Data" section, which says "Odum Institute Dataverse Network". The website should list 5 results. We are interested in only two of them, namely *National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) Wave I, 1994-1995* (Wave I Dataset) and *National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) Wave III, 2001-2002* (Wave III Dataset).

**Step 2** Open the two datasets and click on the blue "Access Dataset" option on the right of the screen. Select "Original Format ZIP". Then you will be required to sign in a guest book and agree to the Add Health and Dataverse terms of use. Enter your information and hit "Accept". 

**Step 3** Inside the Wave I Dataset, the file we are interested in is "w1context_dvn.sav". Inside the Wave III Dataset, there are three data files that we are intersted in, namely "w3educatn_dvn.sav", "w3pvt_dvn.sav", and "w3graduatn_dvn_3.sav".
